üöó ETL Pipeline Project for a Reputed Automobile Client (Professional Project)  
üìå Overview
This project involved the design, development, and maintenance of a scalable data engineering pipeline for a leading automobile group consisting of brands like Audi, Skoda, and Volkswagen. The core objective was to enable efficient processing, transformation, and validation of sales and planning data to generate accurate business insights and support decision-making across departments.

The system was built entirely on AWS Cloud, leveraging key services for orchestration, monitoring, and data storage.

üßë‚Äçüíª My Role
As a Data Engineer in the Analytics team, I was actively involved throughout the pipeline lifecycle. My key contributions included:

Designing and building ETL pipelines using PySpark on AWS Glue for high-volume data ingestion and transformation.

Ensuring 100% accuracy in month-end reports by loading and validating master data across development and production environments.

Replacing Excel-based manual steps with automated Spark logic, which reduced processing time by ~30% and significantly lowered error rates.

Developing a custom PySpark job to process deeply nested XML files, which was successfully deployed as a production-grade job.

Creating CloudWatch logs and Lambda-based alerts to monitor job health and proactively identify failures.

Collaborating closely with senior analysts, Power BI teams, and clients to define KPIs and translate business requirements into technical implementations.
